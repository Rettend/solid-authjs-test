## Setup a GitHub app

In order to run this example, you need to setup a GitHub app here: <https://github.com/settings/developers>, to get a client secret and client id which should be added to the .env file. Also, in the GitHub app settings, set the Authorization callback URL to: <http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github>
